This project would not have been possible without the generous support of Plasmatic Technologies Inc (https://www.plasmatic.ai/).

Plasmatic is working to unleash the power of a smart home, in part through their Alana Connected Home System, and they focus on the intersection of power systems, connected devices, and consumer needs.
