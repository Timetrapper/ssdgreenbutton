	  <h3>What is Green Button All About?</h3>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Making metered data available to consumers</dt>
	    <dd>All electric users have meters that are used to measure how much energy they use.&nbsp; This metered data is used by energy service  providers to calculate how much that energy will cost you, the consumer.&nbsp; Green Button is all about making that data available to you - for planning - for analysis - for your benefit!
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Green Button data contains no Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</dt>
	    <dd>Green Button guarantees the consumer's privacy!&nbsp; The Green Button standard requires there is no PII contained within the data, only measured interval usage information.&nbsp; The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cyber-security team has reviewed the content of Green Button data to ensure it meets this requirement.&nbsp; You should ensure your energy provider is a certified Green Button provider.

	  <h3>Metered Data Represented In Standard Format</h3>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Interoperable Standards</dt>
	    <dd>Green Button data implements the North American Energy Standards Board's (NAESB) REQ 21 -- Energy Service Provider Interface (ESPI) energy usage information exchange standard.&nbsp; This standard ensures energy information can easily be exchanged without requiring developers to invest time and money to support proprietary metered data conversion technologies.&nbsp; This enables application developers to create applications that provide services to consumers enabling them to analyze and plan their energy consumption, potentially saving them money.</dd>

	  <h3>Green Button Certified Service Providers</h3>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Validation of Green Button Data Files</dt>
	    <dd>Early Green Button implementations were not consistent in their application of the Green Button standard.&nbsp; This resulted in various interoperability issues and identifiied a clear need for a Green Button certification program.&nbsp; The Green Button Alliance is currently working on the deployment of Green Button certification programs resulting in the issuance of Green Button certification marks.&nbsp; The  presence of a Green Button certification mark on an energy provider's website enables consumers and application developers to confidently rely on the data they receive being Green Button standard compliant.

	  <h3><i>Green Button Download My Data<sup>&reg;</sup></i> (DMD)</h3>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>DMD is the simple starting point</dt>
	    <dd>Many energy providers provide access to energy usage data for their customers through Internet websites.&nbsp; These websites provide a way for consumers to view historical usage data and, in some cases, to download energy usage data for further analysis.&nbsp; Often the downloaded file uses comma-separated value (CSV) formatting and is different for each website.&nbsp; <i>Green Button Download My Data</i> provides downloadable energy data that complies with the Green Button standard ensuring a consistent data format from all energy provider websites.</dd>

	  <h3><i>Green Button Connect My Data<sup>&reg;</sup></i> (CMD)</h3>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>CMD provides automated access to energy information!</dt>
	    <dd><i>Green Button Connect My Data</i> provides application developers an automated technique to access consumer energy information while providing consumers security.&nbsp; CMD requires applications to gain authorization from consumers using the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework standards [RFC6749] and [RFC6750].&nbsp; While such authorization can be obtained in several ways, a typical method requires the consumer to provide authorization using a webpage, similar to how Facebook and Google based applications request users to approve access to their accounts.&nbsp; This results in the application gaining access to the consumer's energy data without the consumer having to provide the userid and password they use to access their energy provider's website.&nbsp; Once this authorization is granted, the application is able to automatically retrieve the consumer's energy data without any further involvement of the consumer.&nbsp; CMD greatly simplifies and drastically improves the ability for applications to retrieve and analyze energy data beyond the capabilities of the DMD process.
