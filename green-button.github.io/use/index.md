	  <h3>Commercial Energy Users</h3>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Virtual Energy Audits</dt>
	    <dd>Energy audits have proven to be a valuable tool in the management of commercial properties. The ability to use real usage data as part of the audit process
	      greatly enhances the quality of the audit. But the ability to review that data remotely without the need to physically visit the property, and to do it more
	      frequently  adds further value to the audit process.</dd>
	    <dt>Usage Reconciliation</dt>
	    <dd>It is often difficult to reconcile usage and billing data for commercial properties. Often the billing data is not correlated well so the actual usage on a day-to-day basis. The availability of Green Button interval data greatly enhances the reconciliation process!</dd>
	    <dt>Benchmarking Resource Usage</dt>
	    <dd>Benchmarking for certification and for management purposes provides a way to prove your energy efficiency. The integration of Green Button into the EPA Portfolio Manager benchmarking and certification scoring platform makes the entire process less arduous.</dd>
	    <dt>Validating Efficiency Goals</dt>
	    <dd>Green Button allows you to use real data to prove you are achieving your energy efficiency goals. </dd>

	  <h3>Residential Consumers</h3>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Efficiency Programs</dt>
	    <dd>Residential energy efficiency programs have proven to provide significant impact on our ability to achieve an sustainable energy future. Green Button
	      provides the feed-back loop necessary to fully engage the consumer and achieve the final element of efficiency moving forward.</dd>
	    <dt>Virtual Energy Audits</dt>
	    <dd>As with commercial facilities, the 130 million residential services in North America will greatly benefit from know where they stand with respect to
	      their energy efficiency. The availability of granular interval data for a growing number of residential meters greatly expands the reach of the virtual
	      energy audit.</dd>
	    <dt>Fact Based Service Deployment</dt>
	    <dd>
	      The availability of real usage data makes it much easier to project the value of new services such as residential solar. Knowing the specifics, rather than
	      just rough averages enables fine tuning of such offerings.

	  <h3>Public Institutions</h3>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Management Policy Validation</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Accessibility and transparency of actual data provides new ways to both prove the value of current management policies as well as to enable innovation in
	      the development of new policy refinements.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Quality of Service Analysis</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Knowing the history of service quality allows for analysis of needs and improvements in both process and equipment. Knowing campus or portfolio wide issues
	      can help in improving the overall service quality.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Operational Management</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Internal sub-metering and energy management systems are beginning to support Green Button data formats to enable uniform management processes, based
	      upon near real-time interval data, to provide interoperability across multiple vendor sub-systems.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Benchmarking</dt>
	    <dd>
	      The coming inclusion of Green Button as an input format for the EPA Portfolio Manager API will further enhance the ability to benchmark and certify your
	      portfolio of buildings.
